# spritecooler

Porting SPRITE-seq analysis to the 21st century.

## Introduction
spritecooler is a nextflow pipeline for processing SPRITE-seq data aligned with the 4DN guidelines.
This involves a complete reimplementation of the sprite-pipelines ([1.0[https://github.com/GuttmanLab/sprite-pipeline] and [2.0](https://github.com/GuttmanLab/sprite2.0-pipeline)) in Python
leveraging the [Cooler framework](https://github.com/open2c/cooler) for contact matrix creating, storage and manipulation. This also enables the data to be integrated in existing Hi-C workflows and viewers
such as [higlass](https://higlass.io/)
